##### BUY THE DIP AND WAIT!!! #######
- En cok yaptıkları bu. Mantıklısı da bu.
- As with the stock market, the trick is identifying tops and bottoms. Buying low and selling high, in other words. This is not easy money.

##### BUY THE CORRECTION #######

##### LISTEN SUCCESSFUL TRADERS #######
--------------------------------
-dinle!!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDPAPKPMivM 43:00
-dinle!!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cewuawJHvCU
- USE SETUPS!!!!!!!!!!!
- FIND YOUR OWN STARATEGY AFTER TRY AND FAIL!!!!
- DON'T QUIT. ALL OF THEM ARE THE ONES WHO DID NOT QUIT. LISTEN JASON LEAVITT.
  LISTEN JOHN F AND SEE. THEY TRIED DOING NOTHING FOR 2-2.5 YEARS AND DID NOT QUIT. THEY SAY OTHERS QUIT.
- FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR YOU. DON'T DEVIATE. WAIT!!! AIT!! WAIT LISTEN!!!
- If you stay in trading long enough, and become profitable, you will come to the conclusion that the best and most consistent setups do not happen frequently.
- Warren Buffet once saying the market is like baseball every once in awhile an easy slow pitch comes your way,
except there are no limits on how many pitches you can sit through to get to it.
- Jim Rogers saying he just waits until there's money sitting in the corner and just goes and
picks it up, AKA waits until such an easy trade presents itself that is well defined ( low risk) and takes it.
This all depends on how you define a great setup...how do you know what a great setup is? Heres a hint
from Peter Brandt I remember, he wasnt consistent until he allowed many months to form a pattern.
I fully agree with this ..the longer the time frame in general to form patterns the more reliable
the pattern will hold up. Also tracking the statistics of what patterns work best for you .
- Tim Grittani said that was the key to becoming profitable for him,  he found that multi day breakouts
had the highest percentage win rate by recording his stats.  Paul Tudor Jones said the reason people
lose money is they trade too big, he only used a small amount of his capitol on each trade and waited
for the best setups. You can paper trade to gather stats for yourself, personal statistics are extremely
valuable and the major key to being profitable if done right.
- 	#Charted here by JP Morgan, the average investor vastly underperforms just about every investment class.
#The reason for this huge difference is that investors consistently took money out of funds that have recently underperformed,
#and put it into funds that have recently performed very well.
#It’s the exact opposite of contrarian investing- they’re following success that has already occurred
#rather than identifying success that will likely happen in the future.
#They’re moving away from underperforming sectors to ones that have already gone up in price, so they’re constantly investing
#in market tops and removing money from market bottoms.
#A consistent mistake of that magnitude is literally the difference between a comfortable retirement and a sparse one.
#And people do the same thing for individual stocks and other funds.
#They statistically move to cash after their portfolio has lost value in a market crash,
# which means not only do they lose value in the crash itself, but then also miss out on the recovery.
#To be contrarian in this context means that when most people are euphoric about stocks,
#you’re becoming cautious for rational, mathematical reasons.
#And when most people are afraid due to recently losing money in a downturn,
#you’re becoming optimistic because you see how undervalued many businesses are.
#Most of history’s incredibly successful stock investors- the ones that went on to manage billions of dollars-
#were value investors, which by extension means they were contrarian. They saw value where others did not,
# and they avoided expensive companies that everyone else was enamored with.
#I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. -Warren Buffett
#Value investing is at its core the marriage of a contrarian streak and a calculator. - Seth Klarman, Billionaire Hedge Fund Manager
#Value investing is one of the best ways to step apart from the crowd and to protect oneself from the unpredictable behavior of the
#securities markets. - Irving Kahn, Chairman of Kahn Brothers Group
#Buy value, not market trends or the economic outlook. - Sir John Templeton, Billionaire Investor
#Warren Buffet is the most well-known on the list, as he has made a six-decade career out of buying boring but highly profitable
#companies at cheap or reasonable prices. He bought a struggling newspaper company, a chewing gum company, a bunch of banks, and a hundred other companies like that.
#While everyone was loading up on overvalued tech stocks in the late 90’s, for example, he skipped that and bought 130 million
#ounces of silver instead, which was at its historical low point. When the financial sector collapsed in 2008, he bailed some of them out, structuring very profitable deals for himself should they recover.
#John Templeton started his fortune by buying every stock that was trading for under a dollar in the American markets in 1938
#(of which there were only about a hundred), when the world was becoming a very dark place under Hitler and Hirohito.
#This resulted in him quadrupling his money in a few years.
#Seth Klarman generated better than 16% annualized returns for over three decades so far, by analyzing the liquidation
#value of companies, and buying struggling companies at such low prices that his risk is kept at low levels.
#Irving Kahn doubled his money from the 1929 market crash.  He recognized the bubble, shorted it, and made a killing,
#and went on to become the oldest active investor in the world until his death in 2015 at 109 years of age
#Michael Burry, MD, played by Christian Bale, shorted the housing market with his fund, and due to the structure of
#his shorting investment, was paying massive premiums to investment banks until he was correct, which nearly unraveled his fund
#as investors wanted to withdraw money, until he was proven right. Him and his investors made a ton of money when the housing market collapsed.
#He’s the ultimate example of a contrarian- he has Asperger’s Syndrome, and came from an outsider’s perspective (as a physician
#rather than a financial professional), and so he simply looked at the numbers, and rationally invested his fund’s money based on them,
#even though almost everyone in the financial industry thought he was insane.

##### KNOW HUMAN PYSCO #######
--------------------------------
#Stock Market movement is nothing but a mix and match of Mathematics and Human psychology...and Technical Analysis is all about these
#two attributes.
#Every human in this world thinks alike and that gave birth to technical analysis.
#When market moves positive everyone invests expecting a further positive movement but when small downtrend is seen people
#book profits expecting that small profits they are generating would be lost...but
#When market goes down, most of people hold first they think that they would exit if again it comes to costprice..market falls further...
#they average it out and thus increasing their losses...
#The correct way is to cut the losses by placing correct stoploss and add up more stocks with the profits with maintaining trailing
#stoplosses but unfortunately 97% traders and investors do it exactly opposite...
#Thats the reason...97% people loose their money in stock market as that money goes to 3% people who do it in correct way and hence
#they are called as smart investors...you might have heard this name...
#All the game of stock market is support and resistance levels...
#those who do good calculation of support and resistance levels would in most of the case make huge money from stock market..
#Breakout is seen breaching the resistance and Breakdown is seen breaching the supports...this is where the profits are hidden.
#Understand the trendlines...supports...resistance..patterns and indicators and you can earn huge money from stock market as
#patterns were developed based on human tendency on a particular event..
